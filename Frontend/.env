# API Configuration
# For local development, uncomment the line below:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api

# IMPORTANT: Keep this commented out for production!
# When deployed to Vercel, the app will automatically use the smart detection
# in api.js which will use the production backend URL you configure there.

# For local network testing (access from phone on same WiFi):
# 1. Find your IP: ipconfig getifaddr en0
# 2. Uncomment and set: VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_IP:5001/api
